<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project contains our second attempt at implementing Pong. It was written by [Kacper Leśniara](https://github.com/calychas) and me as a better version of [SwingPong](https://github.com/simonusher/SwingPong). 
The improvements over the first version are:
- utilizing [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) for controls and rendering,
- simple AI,
- player names,
- an attempt at implementing a developer console (lol),
- possibility to compile for Android and Desktop.

It still definitely contains multiple bugs and code flaws/smells. As with the first one, it is **definitely discontinued**. Feel free to use it in any way you want though.


### Built With

* Java,
* [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/).
